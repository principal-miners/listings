# Github Setup instructions

Github is a reposotiory of codes that we can share with team mates, recruiters and the general public as well. There are privacy settings for hiding code as well, but we will not go into that.

## Downloading software 

Get the Github software from [this link](https://desktop.github.com/)

NOTE : Make a GitHub account at this point using your email ID associated with this team repo.

## Repositories and codes

All code for a particular project resides in a <i>repository</i>. Each repository (<i>repo</i> for short) can contain different kinds of files, from .py, .R, .ipynb, and even images like .jpg or .png

The repo we are reading this file in is called <b>listings</b>
Repos have to exist in two places to be useful - in GitHub (which is already made) and in your local desktop/laptop. 

A key function of the repo is to sync the codes in your local laptop and the codes in GitHub.

To get the codes into your local laptop, we <b>clone</b> the <i>repository</i> FROM GitHub TO your laptop. 
The software we installed <i>GitHub Desktop</i> helps us to do that. 

## Cloning this repository

1. Goto File -> Clone Repository
2. In the new window, select (if not selected already) the tab called <i>GitHub.com</i>
3. <i>Filter</i> out this Repo's name - <b>listings</b> and select the repo (it should highlight in Blue)
4. Under <i>Local path</i> given underneath, choose a location where you want to save the codes.
5. Click <b>Clone</b>

Once github finishes the process, goto the local path you entered and check that folder. All the files, including this README.MD file should be there.
