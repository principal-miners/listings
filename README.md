# Github Setup instructions

Github is a reposotiory of codes that we can share with team mates, recruiters and the general public as well. There are privacy settings for hiding code as well, but we will not go into that.

## Downloading software 

Get the Github software from (this link)[https://desktop.github.com/]

## Repositories and codes

All code for a particular project resides in a <i>repository</i>. Each repository (<i>repo</i> for short) can contain different kinds of files, from .py, .R, .ipynb, and even images like .jpg or .png

The repo we are reading this file in is called <b>listings</b>

Repos have to exist in two places to be useful - in GitHub (which is already made) and in your local desktop/laptop. 

A key function of the repo is to sync the codes in your local laptop and the codes in GitHub.
